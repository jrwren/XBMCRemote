# XBMCRemote lets you remote control XBMC from your PC

XBMCRemote is a windows desktop remote control for XBMC.

## It has the following goals
* Let me play with 3rd party WPF controls
* Allow basic remote control functionality from a PC. I am trying to replace my aging (with broken buttons) XBox remote control (yes, old xbox, not 360)
* Allow library and source navigation from the desktop

Yes, you read correctly, this is a playground project. If it is of use to you, good. If not, I am sorry, but I am not maintaining this software for anyone but myself.
